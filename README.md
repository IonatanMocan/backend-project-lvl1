## About Brain Games project

Brain Games is a collection of simple console games. All games have the same structure: it asks you to type your name, explains the rule of the game and waits for your input. If you type three correct consecutive answers, you win (nothing, duh). If you make a mistake, you can launch the game again.

## How to run the project

1.  Open any folder in the terminal where you'd like to copy the game.
2.  Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your computer by typing `node -v` in the terminal. If you don't have it installed, follow the instructions from [nodejs website](https://nodejs.org).
3.  Run this command to clone the project in your directory `git clone git@github.com:IonatanMocan/backend-project-lvl1.git`
4.  Run `make install` to install dependencies
5.  Run `npm link` to install the game locally on your computer
6.  Launch a game with one following commands: `brain-even`, `brain-calc`, `brain-gcd`, `brain-prime` or `brain-progression`
